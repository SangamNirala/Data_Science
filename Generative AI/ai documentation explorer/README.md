# LangChain Documentation Helper

A repository for learning LangChain by building a generative AI application. This project aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding LangChain's capabilities by creating a web application that utilizes Pinecone as a vector store for answering questions based on LangChain's official documentation.

## Tech Stack
- **Client**: Streamlit
- **Server Side**: LangChain ðŸ¦œðŸ”—
- **Vectorstore**: Pinecone ðŸŒ²

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emarco177/documentation-helper.git
   ```

2. Go to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd documentation-helper
   ```

3. Download LangChain Documentation:
   ```bash
   mkdir langchain-docs
   wget -r -A.html -P langchain-docs https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

## Usage Instructions

To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
Once the application is running, you can interact with it through your web browser. The application allows users to input prompts and receive responses generated by a language model, with the ability to reference documentation sources.

## Ingestion Process

The application ingests documentation from LangChain using the following methods:
- **Ingesting from ReadTheDocs**: The `ingestion.py` file contains functions to load documentation from the LangChain API, split the text into manageable chunks, and store them in a Pinecone vector store for efficient retrieval.
- **Web Scraping**: Additional documentation can be ingested using web scraping techniques to gather relevant information from various LangChain documentation URLs.

## Running Tests

To run tests, execute the following command:
```bash
pipenv run pytest .
```
