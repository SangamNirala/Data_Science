# Advanced RAG control flow with LangGraphü¶úüï∏:

Implementation of Reflective RAG, Self-RAG & Adaptive RAG tailored towards developers and production-oriented applications for learning LangGraphü¶úüï∏Ô∏è.

This repository contains a refactored version of the original [LangChain's Cookbook](https://github.com/mistralai/cookbook/tree/main/third_party/langchain),

## Features

- **Refactored Notebooks**: The original LangChain notebooks have been refactored to enhance readability, maintainability, and usability for developers.
- **Production-Oriented**: The codebase is designed with a focus on production readiness, allowing developers to seamlessly transition from experimentation to deployment.
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures the reliability and stability of the application, enabling developers to validate their implementations effectively.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation and branches guide developers through setting up the environment, understanding the codebase, and utilizing LangGraph effectively.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:

- **ingestion.py**: Responsible for loading and processing documents from specified URLs into a vector store.
- **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the workflow and handles user queries.
- **graph/**: Contains the core logic of the graph-based application, including:
  - **consts.py**: Defines constants for node names to avoid code duplication.
  - **state.py**: Manages the state of the graph during execution.
  - **nodes/**: Contains implementations of various nodes, including:
    - **generate.py**: Handles the generation of responses based on retrieved documents.
    - **grade_documents.py**: Evaluates the relevance of retrieved documents.
    - **retrieve.py**: Retrieves relevant documents based on user queries.
    - **web_search.py**: Performs web searches using the Tavily search engine.
  - **chains/**: Contains the logic for chaining nodes together, including:
    - **answer_grader.py**: Grades the relevance of answers.
    - **generation.py**: Manages the generation of responses.
    - **hallucination_grader.py**: Checks for hallucinations in generated responses.
    - **router.py**: Routes questions to the appropriate nodes based on conditions.

## Workflow
1. **Ingestion**: Load documents from specified URLs and index them into a vector store.
2. **Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
3. **Grading**: Evaluate the relevance of retrieved documents and filter out irrelevant ones.
4. **Web Search**: If necessary, perform a web search to find additional relevant information.
5. **Generation**: Generate a response based on the relevant documents and the original question.
