# Human Emotions Detection

## Description
This project implements a **deep learning** model for detecting **human emotions** from images using advanced **image classification** techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions, enabling it to classify emotions into categories such as **angry**, **happy**, and **sad**. By leveraging **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of neural networks in the field of **computer vision**.

## Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **TensorFlow**: The primary framework used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training results and data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning utilities and metrics.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
- **Albumentations**: For data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- **WandB**: Weights and Biases for tracking experiments and visualizing results.
- **ONNX**: For exporting the trained model to the ONNX format, enabling interoperability with various platforms and frameworks.

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python seaborn albumentations wandb onnx
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Prepare your dataset in the specified directory structure, ensuring it contains images labeled with the corresponding emotions.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `4-Human Emotions Detection by Neuralearn.ai- (1).ipynb` to train the model and evaluate its performance on the emotion detection task.
4. After training, the model can be exported to the **ONNX** format for deployment and inference in different environments.

## Model Architecture
The project utilizes various deep learning architectures, including:
- **LeNet**: A simple convolutional neural network designed for image classification tasks.
- **ResNet34**: A deeper network that employs residual connections to facilitate training and improve accuracy.
- **EfficientNet**: A family of models that optimize the balance between depth, width, and resolution for enhanced performance in emotion detection.
- **Vision Transformers**: A cutting-edge approach that applies transformer models to image data, demonstrating significant potential in computer vision tasks.

## ONNX Integration
The project includes functionality to export the trained model to the **ONNX** format. This allows for:
- **Interoperability**: The model can be used across different platforms and frameworks that support ONNX, such as PyTorch and Caffe2.
- **Performance Optimization**: ONNX provides tools for optimizing model inference, making it suitable for deployment in production environments.
- **Ease of Use**: Users can easily convert their TensorFlow/Keras models to ONNX format, facilitating integration into various applications.
